This FISH oligo design pipeline provides the oportunity to run either both vmatch runs, or only the first one.
The final database will contain the following values in the "DISCARDED" column: 0, 1, and 2. 
'0' - (=false) the oligo was not discarded in the second vmatch run
'1' - (=true) the oligo was discarded in the second vmatch run
'2' - only the first vmatch run was executed.
